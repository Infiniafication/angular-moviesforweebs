# angular-moviesforweebs

Author: Isaac Yong
Message from the author (me, duh!):
o Required for pre-interview task: https://revenuemonster.github.io/
o The general idea for this web app is to display anime movies (originating from Japan) and show their relevant information. 

Planned features:
- Simple filters by genre
- Simple animations (possibly using jQuery animations)

Tentative (requires experimentation):
- OAuth login


-------- Personal notes below this line --------
TODO:
1. Add release year.
2. Make banner fancy.
3. Try implementing Material Angular.

Maybes:
1. Details page
2. Movie trailers

Ponder:
1. Why should users have to login?
